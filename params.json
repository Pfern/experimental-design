He can perhaps say what the experiment died of.” - R.A. Fisher \r\n\r\nModern technologies are able to deliver an unprecedented amount of data rapidly. However, without due care and attention early in the experimental process, such data are meaningless if they cannot adequately answer the intended research question. This course is aimed at those planning high-throughput experiments and highlights the kinds of questions they should be asking themselves.\r\nThe course consists of a lecture and small-group discussions led by a member of the Genomics or Bioinformatics Cores.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
